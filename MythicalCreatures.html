          A Banshee is said to be a fairy in Irish legend and her scream is believed to be an omen of death. The scream is also called ‘caoine’ which means ‘keening’ and is a warning that there will be an imminent death in the family and as the Irish families blended over time, it is said that each family has its own Banshee!
          <p>
          A Banshee is a disembodied spirit and can appear in any of the following forms:
        </p>
          - A beautiful woman wearing a shroud
        <p>
          - A pale woman in a white dress with long red hair
        </p>
          - A woman with a long silver dress and silver hair
        <p>
          - A headless woman carrying a bowl of blood that is
         naked from the waist up
       </p>
          - An old woman with frightening red eyes, a green dress and long white hair
          <p>

  <img src= "http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28600000/Phoenix-mythical-creatures-28605111-800-800.png">
  In Greek mythology, a phoenix (Ancient Greek: φοῖνιξ, phoînix) is a long-lived bird that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again.
  <p>
Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the ashes of its predecessor.
According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.
